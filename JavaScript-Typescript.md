- **Lazy Loading**: Strategies to load resources on-demand.

### 9. **Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms**

- **Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs**: Implementing and manipulating advanced data structures.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and understanding algorithm complexity (Big O notation).
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Observer, Factory, and other design patterns in JavaScript.

### 10. **Web APIs and Browser APIs**

- **Fetch API and AJAX**: Making network requests, handling responses, and working with JSON.
- **WebSockets**: Real-time communication with servers.
- **Service Workers**: Creating offline-first web applications, caching strategies.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Efficient techniques for manipulating the DOM, using libraries like jQuery or vanilla JS.

### 11. **Security**

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Understanding CSRF and implementing CSRF tokens.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implementing CSP to prevent various attacks.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Securely managing user sessions and access controls.

### 12. **Testing**

- **Unit Testing**: Writing unit tests with frameworks like Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing combined parts of the application to work together.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Using tools like Selenium, Cypress for automated browser testing.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before code implementation.

### Preparation Resources

- **Online Courses**:
  - Advanced JavaScript on Udemy, Coursera, or Pluralsight.
  - FreeCodeCamp’s JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

- **Practice Platforms**:
  - LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal for coding challenges.
  - Exercism.io for in-depth coding exercises.
